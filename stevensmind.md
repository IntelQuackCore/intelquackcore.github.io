**Steven's Mind** is a short film. The main character Steven, struggles to see the world in a positive light. He must learn that maybe the world is not as bad as he sees it in his head and that the worst won’t always come to pass. Sometimes life is more mundane than terrifying. Steven imagines the world in a skewed way, which will be shown via more experimental production choices for the imagined sequences.

**Writer’s Statement:**
When I was working on developing this story, I knew I wanted to tell a story of self-discovery and almost a coming-of-age tale but set a little bit later in life. No one I know in their early twenties has life figured out yet, and I think the relatability of that uncertainty is something my generation can really relate to. Steven must face a choices not dissimilar from my own in life, and I think I was able to inject a lot of authenticity into Steven this way. The anxiety I personally experienced around this is where the core of Steven’s problem came from. I think that while this story is based partially in my own experience, I think truly anyone can relate and get invested in the struggle that steven is going through.
