For a long time, I have been using last.fm and other ways to keep track of my music listening. I use Rate Your Music to expand what I listen to and it has worked well. I also make a point of having an up-to-date list of my favorite albums of all time, and that is what is shown here.

One of the main downsides I see in streaming services is that a lot of people don't listen to albums as bodies of work anymore. I think there is a lot of value in listening to albums as a whole and fully immersing yourself in the artistâ€™s vision. There are a lot of singles that I like better than some of the tracks on these albums, but the reasons for their placement is based on the album as a unit. This list also changes from time to time. Both because new music comes out, but also because my opinions on albums change over time. As of time of writing, this is the ninth version of this list. I also want to make clear that by no means is this list objective. This is just what I think are some of my personal favorite albums.
