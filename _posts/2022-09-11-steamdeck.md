When I saw the steam deck announcement post, I was conflicted. The tech was very cool but honestly as someone who rarely uses my switch, I was not sure if I could justify it. I waited one day and then decided to put my five dollars down. By waiting just one day I delayed the arrival of my deck by one whole year. 

Almost one year after launch my email came that it was time to pay, and I had another moment of hesitation when it was time to hand over my $530 for the 256gb model I had ordered. It’s a lot of money for a college student and I also have a lot of camera gear on my wish list. I ended up pulling the trigger after seeing that if I ended up not using it, I could easily get my money back on the used market. My deck arrived right before a vacation, and a perfect test of its utility as I would be away from my desk for well over two weeks. I installed four games before I left. Portal 2, Aperture Desk Job, Lego Star Wars (the new one), and Fallout 4. I also packed my switch as sort of a challenge to myself to see what I would reach for first.

Right out of the gate the steam deck came out swinging. As someone with bigger hands I have always had problems holding the switch. So, picking up the deck and feeling how great it felt in the hands was an instant win for the Valve made system. It has large grips and full-sized sticks, and reminded me a lot of my Xbox controllers. All the buttons feel way better than the horrible Joy-con alternative. The main standouts were the analog triggers and the real d-pad (two things completely absent on the switch.) 

Of the four games that I installed, the one that I think worked the best on deck was Lego Star Wars. As the game was made to work on Xbox, the deck controllers mapped perfectly to the game and it ran great. The biggest surprise however was Fallout 4. I was not expecting fallout to run well at all on the deck. Fallout 4 has always had performance problems and I was not expecting the deck’s windows compatibility layer (proton) to help that. Much to my surprise it was a great experience, with decent FPS and controller support. I was also really surprised by how much I found myself using the touchpad for precision aiming in fallout. It made it a lot less clunky to play as a mouse and keyboard gamer. One of the other games that I installed later that had me shocked was Minecraft. Obviously, it ran great but the shock was from how well I was able to use the deck’s “mouse and keyboard to controller” profile to get the game working with the sticks and touchpads. It worked great for remapping the touchpad to mouse movement for aiming as well as mapping the left stick to “WASD”. I have already put a ton of hours into Minecraft on the deck as the battery life is great.

So, after two months with my deck, what are my thoughts? Am I going to keep it? Well in terms of if I am keeping it the answer is a resounding yes. I play it in bed, when I am on the road, on the train, and even just around my apartment. I think that in terms of value it has proved its worth. I am still looking for “the perfect game” for the deck. Some games that work well drain the battery too much, others don’t run well, and some just don’t work without a mouse. Finding the perfect game for the deck is a bit of a fun challenge. So far Lego Star Wars, and Minecraft have been the closest to perfect. One last thing of note is the open source and repairability of the deck. It has OEM parts for sale to anyone and the OS is going to be available for other systems to use.
