As a film major in today’s media focused world, a lot of friends have asked me what video editing software I use, and what I would recommend for them to get into editing. My response has always been the same. DaVinci Resolve is the best deal in the world right now when it comes to video editing. You get the industry standard for color grading, and a good video editor, and a decent mixing DAW for the low price of literally free. The paid version is a one-time price of three hundred dollars, but for most people, the free version of Resolve is more than enough.

I have been using DaVinci Resolve since I was in high school, and the software has come a long way since then. The performance has improved, the features have improved and it is much more of a fully featured product that it was when I started using it over 5 years ago. I have used it to edit my first short film, two near full length documentaries, and countless client projects. I have learned to love the interface, understand how VFX in Resolve’s Fusion tab work and told countless Premiere Pro users what they were missing. 

This is not to say that I have not spent a long time in Premiere Pro, and Avid Media Composer. Since I am a film major, I often have to use the software that the class I am taking is built around. I have taken classes in advanced use of Premiere, as well as the current industry standard, Avid Media Composer. When I started using Avid Media Composer, I was convinced that I was in crazy town. How was this the industry standard? It looked dated, and had such a weird way of doing things, it made me want to pull my hair out. I swore off of it as soon as the classes I took no longer needed it.

*Example of one of my Avid Media Composer projects. My own take on a trailer for La La Land*

Flash forward to about two months ago, and I decided that I should really take advantage of my discounted license while in school and try to learn Avid to a much higher degree than I had already done in my two classes in the subject. I spent a lot of time relearning the workings, and revisiting projects from past systems. As I spent more time in Avid Media Composer, I started to understand the workflow and why Avid is so different and sometimes “bad looking”. 

Avid Media Composer is the best software for simply cutting footage together. It is good at laying out a large project and working from start to finish to assemble it. Because most projects that are edited on Avid have assistant editors, and usually dedicated sound mixers, VFX teams and the like, it doesn’t need to do everything. I have come to realize that while Resolve and Premiere Pro are like a Swiss army knife and great for a broad range of things, Avid is like an actual dedicated screwdriver. Avid Media Composer is amazing at what it is made for, editing. Because so much of my work relies on me to be the editor as well as VFX artist and the sound mixer, I misunderstood what was great about Avid Media Composer. I have since used Avid Media Composer on several projects and I plan on continuing to do so. It is my new favorite NLE when I am working with an assistant, or a larger team that includes a separate colorist and sound mixer. While I will not be suggesting that my friends use Avid Media Composer to edit their TikTok’s, I will continue to use an actual screwdriver to turn screws, not my trusty Swiss army knife.
