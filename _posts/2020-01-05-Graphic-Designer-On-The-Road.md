A while ago I got the domain for this site with the plans to make a blog or some other project at the address. I needed a quick landing page to sit the domain on so I had it redirect to my linktree. And then I did nothing. My page sat like that until I got the time to make something "better". Well here that is. I have no idea what I will do with this page in the future but here it is for now.
