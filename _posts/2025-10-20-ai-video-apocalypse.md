When I wrote my [original AI article](https://www.thetriangle.org/opinion/chatgpt-is-a-clear-and-present-danger/) in The Triangle about how chatbots would rip away our collective humanity, I was just taking stock of how I saw AI like ChatGPT already being used to subvert education, work and learning. With that article, my only goal was to call out what I saw currently happening, today in the moment. Looking back on that article even just a few months later, I will say that everything I warned of has only gotten much worse.

Since that article, OpenAI has unleashed what can only be described as a fire hose of “slop” onto the internet. On September 30, 2025, [OpenAI launched the Sora app](https://openai.com/index/sora-2/), and with it the Sora 2 video generation model. The Sora app is set up to be a TikTok style app exclusively for AI slop videos. 

The videos however, did not stay contained to the Sora app for long. The watermarks were quickly removed, and a torrent of videos of historical figures [saying nonsense](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DP2DD_mksCe/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) was unleashed onto Instagram, TikTok, and most concerning, Facebook. I say most concerning in regard to Facebook because while most people in my generation have the background knowledge from years on the internet to not trust random clips as fact, the older audience on Facebook has been falling for these clips constantly. For example, [this clip](https://www.instagram.com/p/DPqI7-sjeIU/) of John Lennon wearing a hat with a McDonald’s logo on it in an interview would easily fool most people I know that are my parents age (60) or older.

While most of the slop to come out of Sora so far has been silly, or obviously fake, like the AI generated video posted by Donald Trump of him [dropping poop](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115398251623299921) on protesters out of an airplane, I am sure that no good will come of this. While AI generated photos and articles are damaging to [our collective intelligence](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/lee_2025_ai_critical_thinking_survey.pdf) and the record of human history, I propose that AI generated videos pose an even greater threat. Now that OpenAI and Google have video generation models that can also produce dialog and sound to go along with them, the ability for us to determine what actually happened or is happening currently in our world is at risk. While OpenAI made a token effort to label videos made with Sora using a watermark, people have already figured out how to crop out, or remove any signs that point to a video being made with AI, as shown [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/DQAVAkdD4tn/).

While conservatives love to quote George Orwell’s 1949 book “1984”, often for the wrong reasons, I believe that the books focus on the dangers of historical revisionism is directly applicable to the rise of Sora, and AI more broadly. The antagonist political party’s slogan is “Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past." The antagonist, Mr. O’Brien asks the question “Is there somewhere or other a place, a world of solid objects, where the past is still happening?” and if not “Then where does the past exist, if at all?” saying, “We, the Party, control all records, and we control all memories. Then we control the past, do we not?”

Sora and Generative AI videos, photos and articles are a vehicle that will allow the revision, modification, and ultimately, the destruction of the historical record. Anything can be backed up with phony video evidence. It is fun to laugh at videos of news anchors saying [pee and fart](https://www.instagram.com/p/DQAVAkdD4tn/), or Ronald Reagan saying nonsense words in funny hats, but you have to be blind, ignorant or naive to not see where this is going. Donald Trump has already shown a willingness to use AI to distort the historical record. He shared [a video](https://youtu.be/35gGuWlhKBU?si=MdJLE4a7b2JlwNwQ) that modified footage from a press conference using AI, showing Democratic minority leader Chuck Schumer saying that he hated American citizens. The official Senate Republicans account on X.com shared [this video](https://x.com/NRSC/status/1979187237720924195) that was generated with AI of Schumer, appearing to show him celebrating the hardship that the government shutdown has brought on Americans.

I have no idea what the solution is, but I foresee a dark road ahead when it comes to propaganda and misinformation. Besides avoiding using AI yourself, my only suggestion would be to educate the older folks in your life about how to spot AI generated videos, at least in the short time that we have left where you can actually tell truth from fiction.
